# Predict Hotel Reservation Cancelation with Machine Learning

## This project is for Final Project on Purwadhika Data Science Course

### The aim of this project is to predict whether this hotel reservation will be canceled or not

Data set is from https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand

It consist of 31 independent variable (categorical and numerical) and 1 dependent variable ('is_canceled' -> 0 = not cancel, 1 = cancel)

This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, 
length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things.

The description of all feature can be read on https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191

## Business Problem


## Workflow of Project:

![Workflow](https://github.com/trianzah01/Final_Project/blob/master/Workflow.png)


### 1. Data Cleaning
### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
### 3. Model Building and Model Evaluation 

This project use 3 model:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier

The evaluation metrics that I use are:
1. Classification Report (Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 Score)
2. Confussion Matrix

You can see my works on notebook named "FP - Final Version"
